# TourGuide

## What is?

An app made in Laravel that acts as a repository for touring theatre venues.
Designed as a proof-of-concept for an Arts Council grant.

### No but what does it do

Stores details about touring theatre venues, organised into their respective regions and areas.
Has information about what types of deal are considered for venues, as well as any access equipment the venue has.

## Where could it go from here?

As of 2023-05-08 it is a means of storing, displaying, and modifying theatre details.
Currently doesn't have the ability to:

- Create venues
- Create access equipment
- Edit access equipment
- Create deal types
- Edit deal types

These are the basic CRUD features I would like it to have

### What about the real pie-in-the-sky bollocks

Having discussed with a theatre technician friend of mine the idea of having multiple stages for a single venue.
That'll require a real update to the database schema.
Additional fields also will want considering - what's there presently is a very nonexhaustive list of things that a techie would find useful.
